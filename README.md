# Weather Widget

This is a simple weather widget I built while learning Remix. It is built with Remix and Tailwind CSS and utilizes the OpenWeather API.

## Technologies
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [Tailwind CSS (widget template)](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Usage
- Clone this repo locally.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jaguilar89/remix-weather-app.git
```
- Run the project in development mode.
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
- Visit `localhost:3000`, then simply enter the US Zip Code for the location you want to get weather info for.
